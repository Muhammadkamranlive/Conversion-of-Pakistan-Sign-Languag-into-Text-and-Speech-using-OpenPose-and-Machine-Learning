# Conversion of Pakistan Sign Language into text and speech using Machine Learning
The University of Lahore (Department of CS & IT) (Fall 2015 â€“ Spring 2019) - Final Year Project

#### The project is divided into 3 main modules
- RealTime sign detection module - translating Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) alphabet and words into text and speech in realtime.
- Capture Dataset modeule - Automated system for capturing and adding new data to the dataset
- PSl learning module - Learn PSL interactively

## Dependencies
##### The system uses OpenPose library for extacting skelatal features.
##### The code was developed with python 3.7 and has been tested with the libraries/versions in requirements.txt file.

## Dataset Used
We have made our own Pakistan Sign Language (PSL) dataset containing multiple samples of 37 urdu aplhabets and 12 urdu words. The dataset is made publically available at https://www.kaggle.com/saadbutt321/pakistan-sign-language-dataset
